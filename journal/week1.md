# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else.
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defined required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules
```

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag
We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_ud="my-user_id"`

### var-file flag

The `-var-file` flag allows users to specify a file from which Terraform will load variable values, which can be useful for segregating environment-specific variables. By default, Terraform does not recognize any file with the tfvars extension, unless specified using this flag, for instance, `terraform apply -var-file="custom.tfvars"`.

### terraform.tvfars

This is the default file to load in terraform variables in blunk

### auto.tfvars

In the context of Terraform Cloud, any file named `*.auto.tfvars` will be automatically loaded, providing a convenient method for variable definitions without needing explicit flag invocations. This is especially useful in CI/CD pipelines integrated with Terraform Cloud, where variables can be dynamically generated and saved with this naming convention.

### order of terraform variables

The order of precedence for Terraform variables is as follows: command-line flags, environment variables, `auto.tfvars` and its named variants, and lastly the `terraform.tfvars` file. This means that variables defined with the `-var` flag will override those defined in the `terraform.tfvars` or `*.auto.tfvars` files.

## Dealing With Configuration Drift

## What happens if we lose our state file?

If you lose your statefile, you most likley have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually.

You can use terraform port but it won't for all cloud resources. You need check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)
[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone manually deletes or modifies a cloud resource using ClickOps, running a Terraform plan will aim to restore our infrastructure to its desired state, addressing the configuration drift.

## Fix using Terraform Refresh

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only -auto-approve
```

## Terraform Modules

### Terraform Module Structure

It is recommend to place modules in a `modules` directory when locally developing modules but you can name it whatever you like.

### Passing Input Variables

We can pass input variables to our module.
The module has to declare the terraform variables in its own variables.tf

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

### Modules Sources

Using the source we can import the module from various places eg:
- locally
- Github
- Terraform Registry

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
}
```
